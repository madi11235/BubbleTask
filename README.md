# BubbleTask


## Introduction


Basically, BubbleTask is a todo-list or task manager, which helps you to prioritize your tasks. 
The basic idea -- differentiating -- this tool from other task lists is the *automatic prioritization* of your tasks. 

When creating a new task you are asked to enter some basic information about your task, e.g. a due date. Then the app computes a priority for your task depending up on your input. 

The app displays the tasks as bubbles. The bubble size and color depend on the priority, indicating important tasks as big and red; and less important tasks as small and blue. 

This should help you to keep the overview over what is important and what not. Which tasks do you need to start right now and which ones can wait a little longer. 


## Features

### Create a new task

On the main screen you see a text field, where you can enter a description for a new task. 
If you click "Add Task" a GUI opens, where you can enter details of your task. (Cf. explanation of the fields further below.)

You can also click on "Quick Add". This creates a task with the description you entered using the default settings. Hence, you do not need to enter any details to the task in the GUI. 


### Editing a task

After you entered tasks, you will see bubbles appearing. You can click on these bubbles and a window will open, where you can edit the information for this task.


### Task information

When creating a new task or editing it, you can provide the following information: 

- Task description: A short description of your task
- Assignee: Who should work on the task
- Notes: Here you can give more details
- Due date: Date, when is your task due
- Direct customer request: check this, if the customer of your project directly asked for this information (increases the importance)
- High priority: If you check this box, your task is highlighted in a particular way as a high priority task
- Topic for customer call: check this box, if the result of this task needs to be presented in the next customer call
- Involves others: if you need other people to complete the task, check this box (then it is etter to start earlier)
- Project Impact: rate the impact ot the result of the task on your project
- Complexity: Rate the complexity of the task
- Done: Check this box, if your task is done


### Completed tasks
The tasks you completed during the day will be shown as green bubbles on the right hand side. 
They will vanish the next day. 


### Auto-grooming

When you have a lot of tasks that you are tracking, you will not achieve to finish them all for the expected due date. (At least, that's the case for me ;-) )
It is quite cumbersome if the first thing you have to do in the morning is to click through all the overdue tasks. To save the time for this cumbersome work, there is the auto-grooming feature. 

Auto-grooming screens all your tasks, sorts out overdue tasks and shifts their due date to the date of today. 

You find the auto-grooming by opening the "Edit" Menu in the main screen and clicking on "Auto Groom".

## Saving the tasks

The tasks are automatically saved in a text file called "tasks.tsk". You do not need to trigger the saving of tasks.
