# BubbleTask


## Introduction


Basically, BubbleTask is a todo-list or task manager, which helps you to prioritize your tasks. 
The basic idea -- differentiating -- this tool from other task lists is the *automatic prioritization* of your tasks. 

When creating a new task you are asked to enter some basic information about your task, e.g. a due date. Then the app computes a priority for your task depending up on your input. 

The app displays the tasks as bubbles. The bubble size and color depend on the priority, indicating important tasks as big and red; and less important tasks as small and blue. 

This should help you to keep the overview over what is important and what not. Which tasks do you need to start right now and which ones can wait a little longer.
