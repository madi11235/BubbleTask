**Contribution guidelines**

Hey ou there. I am working on this task manager as a hobby project. But I am actually also using it in my day to day work. 
Hence, I am trying to constantly improve the tool and add relevant and useful features. 

If you are interested in the basic idea of the BubbleTasks task manager, I would be more than happy, if you would join me in improving the tool. 
Feel free to just add features, if you like, or improve the tool. 

I would appreciate, if you would get in touch with me if would like to contribute. 

Looking forward to hearing from you.
